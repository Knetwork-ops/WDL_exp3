		<td>One Plus 7 Pro <br><br> Rating<br>9/10<br><br><a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/oneplus-7-pro-13029">Refrence</td>

		<td>The OnePlus 7 Pro's triple camera setup is similar to those found on other smartphones, but the differences are in the details. Despite the main camera having a 48-megapixel image sensor, it doesn't actually spit out photos with all of those pixels. Instead, it uses a technique called "pixel binning" to combine four pixels together for every one pixel and then produce a sharper 12-megapixel photo.</td>
		<td>The Snapdragon 855 chip gets credit for most of the OnePlus 7 Pro's responsiveness, but so too should the faster UFS 3.0 storage. Most phones use UFS 2.1 flash storage and it's fine, but with UFS 3.0 everything feels faster because under the hood, there's more data being read, which translates to speed across the board.</td>
		<td>For the most part, the OnePlus 7 Pro battery usually lasts one to one and a half days — about the same as the OnePlus 6T. However, you can definitely stretch that to two days if you do things like reduce usage, switch on the system-wide dark theme, or lower the display's brightness and resolution.</td>

		<td>Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ <br><br> Rating<br>7/10 <br><br><a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-review-india-price-2097887">Refrence</td>

		<td>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ was super quick (almost real-time) to lock focus, and the scene optimiser set the camera correctly for whatever we were shooting. Daylight samples had excellent dynamic range, and the phone enables HDR effectively when the need arises. Objects at a distance were recognisable, as the primary sensor does an excellent job at reproducing detail. Even when shooting in bright conditions, we noticed that the phone could set the exposure without overexposing anything.</td>
		<td>Hardware prowess is a given for Samsung’s Note devices. An Exynos 9825 processor is at the heart of this device and teams up with 12GB of RAM. It’s gaming-ready and aced our AnTuTu benchmark test (with a score of 353440). We tested the 256GB internal storage version; there’s also a 512GB variant. Both devices have room for Micro SD cards up to 1TB. </td>
		<td>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus battery life will get you through more than a day, and it charges much more quickly than previous Samsung phones. We had 20% to 30% battery life after heavy use thanks to the hefty 4,300mAh battery capacity. That's roughly what we saw with the Galaxy S10 Plus, which had a smaller battery capacity, but also a smaller screen. More-than-all-day-battery achievement is aided by Samsung's power management having been greatly refined over the years and the fact that the QuadHD+ display resolution isn't on by default – it's set to 1080p out of the box.</td>

		<td>Huawei P30 Pro <br><br> Rating<br>6/10 <br><br><a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/huawei-p30-pro-12307">Refrence</td>
		<td><img  src="c.jpg" width="804" height="809" ></img></td>
		<td>The P30 Pro has an interesting camera arrangement at the back, with three main sensors joined by a time-of-flight module. The primary 40MP module is joined by a 20MP wide-angle lens and an 8MP zoom lens with 5x optical zoom and 10x hybrid zoom. The zoom module in particular is very interesting as it uses a periscope lens that sits inside the chassis, with a mirror reflecting light from a 90-degree angle.</td>
		<td>Coming to the hardware side of things, the P30 Pro uses the same Kirin 980 platform as the Mate 20 Pro. Huawei was the first to roll out a chipset on the 7nm node, and the Kirin 980 is just as fast as the Snapdragon 855. </td>
		<td>Battery life has been a strong point for Huawei for some years now, and the P30 Pro is no different. The phone delivers the best battery life of any "true" flagship in the market today, easily outmatching the Galaxy S10+ and Pixel 3 XL. The 4200mAh unit easily delivers two days' worth of use consistently, and the 40W wired charging is also better than what Google and Samsung manage.</td>
